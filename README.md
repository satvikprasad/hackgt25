### What is Promptly?
Promptly is a prompt-based agentic interface for your computer, and is capable of performing complex tasks in succession thanks to a feedback-driven event loop, and powerful object detection CV models that scan your screen periodically (all CV models are run locally).

This was made possible by the fantastic pretrained Yolo11n weights in Microsoft's OmniParser project, and the RICO dataset. Currently, inference is still a little slow when using GPT-5, while Gemini is a lot faster (~20s for a single task), at the cost of accuracy.
